First of all, I loved my life. But now I'm at the point that nothing important is no longer here.

I've tried to kill my self in so many different ways. I can teach over 100 ways to kill yourself, but I can't do them for my self.

So, I've found a combination of things that my helpo on my way.
first: don't do it sober. You Just Can't. My selection is:
Hasis
Goos sativa
5 litres of vine
0,7 litres of liqour
Ketiapin
and just for backup something to drop my body down if tries to fight me, I use Propral.
